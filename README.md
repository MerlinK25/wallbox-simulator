# Wallbox Simulator ðŸ¤–

This web application can be used to simulate a simple OCPP 2.0 charging device (aka. wallbox). This
can be quite useful in situations when you don't have a real wallbox at hand (or if it's imply too
cumbersome to work with a real device ðŸ˜‰).

The idea is to support eMobility charging application developers by allowing them to step through
the most common scenarios that happen during a typical charging session.  


The simulator is built with with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).
